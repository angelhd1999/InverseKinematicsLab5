Fifth deliverable, Lab 5 of Interactive Systems<br />

To see the **scene** go to: **Assets/FastIK/Scenes/ZombiesAttack**

This is the **list of improvements** that I have made over the version obtained through the tutorial:<br />

  - **Animation of walking slowed down.** from previous speed.<br />
  - **Trunk leaning forward** to get the tired look of a zombie.<br />
  - **Arms leaning forward.**<br />
  - **Legs higher** when walking.<br />
- Added **diferent and new materials** to the elements (the first three are obtained  through the *asset store*):<br />
  - **Brick material** to the wall.<br />
  - **Stone matrial** to the step (to simulate a grave).<br />
  - **Grass material** to the ground.<br />
  - **Dark green material** to the man, now a zombie.<br />
- **Added brain** insted of the green sphere **to simulate the behavior of a zombie** (obtained  through the *asset store*).<br />
- Added **sound effect of a breathing zombie**.<br />
- **Illumination readjustment** to simulate **night**.<br />
- **Camera angle and position readjustment**. Also changed the **bakcground color** to a dark blue (night sky).<br />
